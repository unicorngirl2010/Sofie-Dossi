            Sofie Clarice Dossi (born: June 21, 2001 [age 20]), is an American YouTuber, Actress, Gymnast and Contortionist. She was a golden buzzer recipient on America's Got Talent's 11th season in 2016, made many appearances on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and was nominated for a Streamy Award in 2017 and 2020.

            Sofie Dossi appeared in the 11th season of NBC’s reality competition series ‘America’s Got Talent’ that premiered on May 31, 2016. Nick Cannon returned as the host, as did three of the four judges from the previous season: Howie Mandel, Mel B, and Heidi Klum. Creator Simon Cowell stepped in to take Howard Stern’s place as the fourth judge for the season. ‘America’s Got Talent’ aired 23 episodes that season. The season finale was broadcast on 14 September.

            Dossi made her first appearance on the show in round two, in which Reba McEntire was serving as the guest judge. Her first performance, which included eating an apple and shooting an arrow with her feet, received positive votes from all the four judges. However, it was her second performance of the night that earned her the golden buzzer from McEntire, which effectively promoted her to the live shows.

            She next performed in the week two of the quarter-finals and subsequently advanced to the semi-finals. In the second week of the semi-finals, Dossi was the ninth contestant to perform and made it to the finals via “dunkin’ save.”

            Dossi’s last performance on the show took place on 13 September, in the first round of the finals. She finished the season as one of the top ten contestants. Singer and ukulele player Grace VanderWaal was the eventual winner, with the magician and mentalist duo The Clairvoyants being the runner-up.

            Dossi’s family has contributed significantly to her social media success. She is home-schooled by her mother so that she can keep up with her busy travel schedule. Her father makes most of the equipment that she uses. Her brother, Zak, is her co-star, primary cameraperson, editor, and co-producer. Zak also has a channel of his own, with about 40 thousand subscribers and more than 500 thousand views.

            Sofie Dossi is also an aspiring actress. She made her screen debut in a 2016 episode of Disney Channel’s comedy series ‘K.C. Undercover’. She then appeared in an episode of yet another Disney Channel comedy series, ‘Bizaardvark’, in 2017. In 2018, she landed the role of Dani in Brat’s web series ‘Boss Cheer’.

            Dossi did start building some of her contortion skills when she trained in gymnastics and dance as a kid, but that was just the jumping off point. "I always loved gymnastics and dance and it was like combine those two together, plus my unique skill of having a flexible back," she shared in an interview with ABC News. She really just knew what she was born to do.
